# Computer Architecture and Logic
#### Read: 06 submission 

#### Hello, This is Fatima. You can view my Markdown webpage using the following [link](https://fati-ma.github.io/reading-notes/Read06)

#### In this blog I will give a summary for the following 3 videos about Computer Logic :

##### Note: Keywords are emphasised.

## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

1. ***Processor***: Central Processor Unit (CPU)
2. ***Storage***: Memory (RAM)
3. ***Input***: (keyboard, mouse, etc)
4. ***Output***: (monitor, printer, etc)

## Circuits and Logic

***Logic circuit***, ***electric circuit*** whose output depends upon the input in a way that can be expressed as a function in symbolic logic; 
it has one or more ***binary inputs*** (capable of assuming either of two states like  on  or  off ) and a ***single binary output***. 
Logic circuits that perform particular functions are called ***gates***. 
Basic ***logic circuits*** include the ***AND gate, the OR gate, and the NOT gate***, which perform the logical functions AND, OR, and NOT.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

1. ***CPU***: All the clculations are done here (Calculates information)
2. ***Memory***: Stores the information 
3. Input: Converts physical input to binary information
4. Output: Converts information to physical output
