# Welcome to my GitHub Pages

### In this blog I will be explaining what I have learned so far about Markdown and how to display my webpage using Jejyll themes.

I also checked these resources provided by the instructor for further information [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

# I will apply the different **Markdown _formatting syntax_** through this blog.

# I found this quote very interseting and would like to share it with you:
"Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all ~~sunshine and rainbows~~. It’s a mean place and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. ***But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!*** Now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!"

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fati-ma/reading-notes/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
