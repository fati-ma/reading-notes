# Welcome to my GitHub Pages

### In this blog I will be explaining what I have learned so far about Markdown and how to display my webpage using Jekyll themes.

I also checked these resources provided by the instructor for further information [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

#### I will apply the different **Markdown _formatting syntax_** through this blog.

#### I found this quote very interseting and would like to share it with you and explain the formatting syntax I used:
>"Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all ~~sunshine and rainbows~~. It’s a mean place and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. ***But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!*** Now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!"
by **Rocky Balboa**


```markdown
I used > to block the quote
I used **This to bold text** and _This to make text italicized_ 
also ***This to state that this text is important*** 
and **This to emphasis _certain word_ in the text**
and ~~This was mistaken text~~
I also used
# --> For the title of the webpage
### and #### --> For other important headlines other than the title 
```


##### Here we have the photo Github Markdown logo!

##### Here I made a table of the course contents:
101 Course | 102 Course
------------ | -------------
HTML | Markdown
CSS | Github


##### So, what I have shown so far are these rules: :+1:
1. Headers
2. Emphasis
3. Links
4. Blocks
5. Images
6. Highlighting
7. Tables
8. Emojies
9. Lists (Which I'm using now!)

#### This is my check list for today:
- [ ] Revising the lecture and labs
- [ ] Exploring Github more
- [x] Practicing Markdown



#### I hope you like it, thanks in advance for your efforts!
