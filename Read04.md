#### In this blog I will give a summary for the chapters 1, 8, 17 and 18 of the book: "HTML & CSS" :books: :


## Chapter 1: Structure

- HTML pages are text documents. 
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements. 
- Tags usually come in pairs. 
- The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value. 
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, and what they do.


 ## Chapter 8: Extra Markup 

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers. 
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.


## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.


## Chapter 18: Process & Design

- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. 
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
