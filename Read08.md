# Operators and Loops
#### Read: 08 submission 


#### Hello, This is Fatima. You can view my Markdown webpage using the following [link](https://fati-ma.github.io/reading-notes/Read08)


#### In this blog I will give a summary for the following 2 topics from the book "Javascript and Jquery" :

 - [x] Comparison and logical operators
 - [x] for and while loops


##### Note: Keywords are emphasised.


## Comparison and logical operators

#### The image below shows the comparison operators with examples:

## for and while loops


#### The example below explains the `for` loop:

![for](https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/c-for-statement.png)


**Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.



#### The example below explains the `while` loop:

![while](https://i0.wp.com/pandabunnytech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/js-while-loop.png?w=656)


This loop will continue to run
for ***as long as the condition in
the parentheses is true***. That
condition is a counter indicating
that, as long as the variable
i remains less than 5, the
statements in the subsequent
code block should run.
