# Programming with JavaScript
#### Read: 07 submission 

#### Hello, This is Fatima. You can view my Markdown webpage using the following [link](https://fati-ma.github.io/reading-notes/Read07)

#### In this blog I will give a summary for the following 3 topics from the book "Javascript and Jquery" :

 - [x] Intro + Scripts
 - [x] Expressions + Operators
 - [x] Functions

##### Note: Keywords are emphasised.

## Intro + Scripts

1. A **script** is a *series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal*.
2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the **instructions**.
3. **Computers approach** tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task programmatically.
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task. 


## Expressions + Operators

1. **Expressions** rely on things called **operators**; *they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values*. 

2. `ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS` Assign a value to a variable ```color = 'beige';```

3. `ARITHMETIC OPERATORS` Perform basic math ```area = 3 * 2;```

**ORDER OF EXECUTION** Multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction. To change the order in which
operations are performed, place the calculation you want done first inside parentheses `( )`. 

4. `STRING OPERATORS` Combine two strings ```greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';``` 

There is just one string operator: the `+` symbol.
It is used *to join the strings on either side of it*.

## Functions

Functions let you *group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task*. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function.

#### Some notes on functions:

1. The finction should have a name if it performs a task, and when you ask it to perform it's called **calling** the function.
2. Some functions need to be provided with information in order to perform the task, these information are called **parameters**
3. When the function is expected to provide the programmer with a vlaue or answer, this answer is called **return value**

#### Declaring a function
